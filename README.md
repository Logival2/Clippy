# Clippy
``./python3 main.py`` to launch a game using world generation, other wise specify the map name as an argument  

## The game
Theme: A space explorator crashed on a planet, must find all the needed parts for his spaceship  

#### Mechanics
Turn by Turn?  
Permadeath?  

## Character creation ?

## Multiplayer coop (target 4 players)

## Procedural generation  

#### Examples from dwarf fortress
```
The process involves procedurally generated basic elements like rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature.
For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make a swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment.
They have their own specific type of plant and animal populations.
The next phase is erosionâ€”which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes.[11] The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains.
Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.[11]
After a few minutes the world is populated and its history develops for the amount of in-game years selected in the history parameter. Civilizations, races and religions spread and wars occur,[12] with the "population" and "deaths" counters increasing.
The ticker stops at the designated "years" value, at which point the world can be saved for use in any game mode. Should the player choose to retire a fortress, or should they be defeated, this world will persist and will become available for further games.
```

#### Regions (biomes)
For regions: [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)  

5 regions (equivalent to a minecraft biome) with a specific civilisation each time (kinda like Horizon zero dawn)  
* specific language
* specific colors
* specific behaviors?
* specific animals and ecosystems  
How big should a region be? Needs playtesting to see how much time is needed per area, and how much time should be spent in each region (fun wise)

[Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress)  

#### Strange animals made with Conway game of life (mushroom like?)  

#### Simulate water, and food  

## Clients
#### Curses  
One with a Colored CLI using curses (python wrapper around ncurses)  
https://jonasjacek.github.io/colors/ for terminal color list  
Uses Unicode chars for display variety:  
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_des_caract%C3%A8res_Unicode_(0000-0FFF)  

#### PyGame  
Other one (main one?) using PyGame  
visual look must be constrained to a pixel art style for ease of development  
Max 16px*16px sprites recommended  
not aimed at a realistic look
