# Clippy
WIP, launch main.py with the map name as argument, otherwise a map will be generated (still experimental)

Turn by Turn for performance, allows a more thoughtful gameplay as permadeath is enabled  

## Multiplayer coop (4) ?  
ECS server only, will send all the screen to each player everytime?

## Procedural generation  
For regions: [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
```The process involves procedurally generated basic elements like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature.[1] For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make a swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment.[10] They have their own specific type of plant and animal populations. The next phase is erosionâ€”which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some form into lakes.[11] The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers.[10] The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.[11]
After a few minutes the world is populated and its history develops for the amount of in-game years selected in the history parameter. Civilizations, races and religions spread and wars occur,[12] with the "population" and "deaths" counters increasing.[7] The ticker stops at the designated "years" value, at which point the world can be saved for use in any game mode. Should the player choose to retire a fortress, or should they be defeated, this world will persist and will become available for further games.```
